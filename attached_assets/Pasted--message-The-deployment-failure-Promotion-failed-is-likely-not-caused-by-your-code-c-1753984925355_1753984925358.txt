  "message": "The deployment failure ('Promotion failed') is likely **not** caused by your code changes, but rather by a temporary Replit deployment system issue or misconfiguration. Since your application works in the workspace, here's how to proceed:\n\n### 🔍 Root Cause of 'Promotion Failed'\nThis error typically occurs during the deployment pipeline's 'promote' stage when:\n- The server starts but doesn't respond to health checks properly\n- There's a race condition in the startup sequence\n- The `run` command exits unexpectedly in the deployment environment\n\n### ✅ Immediate Action Steps\n\n**1. Verify Your Server is Listening Correctly**\nEnsure your `dist/index.js` (production build) explicitly listens on the correct port:\n\n```ts\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\n**2. Check Build Success**\nConfirm `npm run build` completes successfully and generates valid code in `dist/`.\n\n**3. Test in Workspace First**\nRun `npm run start` in the workspace and verify:\n- Server starts without errors\n- You can access `/api/vehicles` directly in the preview\n- No unhandled promise rejections\n\n### 🛠️ Critical Fix: Add Health Check Endpoint\nReplit Deploy expects a root route that responds quickly. Add this **before** any middleware:\n\n```ts\n// Health check - must be first route\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.set('X-Replit-No-Auth', 'true');\n  res.set('X-Replit-Public', 'true');\n  res.send('OK');\n});\n```\n\n### 📝 Manual .replit File Update (Required)\nYou **must** add this to your `.replit` file manually:\n\n```toml\n[deployment]\ndeploymentTarget = \"autoscale\"\nbuild = [\"npm\", \"run\", \"build\"]\nrun = [\"npm\", \"run\", \"start\"]\npublicRoutes = [\"/api/*\", \"/\", \"/manifest.json\", \"/assets/*\", \"/favicon.ico\"]\n```\n\n### 🔄 Recovery Strategy\n\n1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** - Replit's deployment system sometimes has transient failures\n2. **Redeploy** - Click 'Deploy' again after making the above changes\n3. **If still failing**, temporarily change your `run` command to test:\n   ```toml\n   run = [\"node\", \"-e\", \"console.log('OK'); require('./dist/index.js')\"]\n   ```\n\n### 📊 Debugging Checklist\n- [ ] Server listens on `process.env.PORT`\n- [ ] Root `/` route returns 200 immediately\n- [ ] `.replit` file has `publicRoutes`\n- [ ] No `console.error` or unhandled rejections at startup\n- [ ] Build completes without TypeScript errors\n\nThe headers and middleware you've added are correct. This is now a deployment pipeline issue, not an authentication issue. Once the `.replit` file is updated and health checks pass, your API should work.\n\nTry redeploying after making these changes."
