# Fix Replit Deployment - T-Rex Motors

## Problem Identified
Your deployed app (https://trex-motors-keanonbiz.replit.app) redirects to Replit's login page instead of showing your website.

## Root Cause
The deployment is failing because:
1. Production static files path resolution issue (FIXED)
2. Production database may not have your vehicle data
3. Build process may be failing in Replit's deployment environment

## âœ… Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed vite-fallback.ts** - Improved production static file serving
2. **Created production-data.sql** - Your 18 vehicles ready for production import
3. **Build verification** - Confirmed local production build works

## ðŸš€ Next Steps to Fix Deployment

### Step 1: Redeploy with Fixes
1. In Replit, click **Deploy** again
2. The vite-fallback.ts fix should resolve the static file serving

### Step 2: Import Vehicle Data (After Deployment)
Once deployment succeeds, you'll need to import your vehicle data:

```bash
# In the deployed environment
npm run db:push
cat production-data.sql | psql $DATABASE_URL
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
After redeployment, check:
- https://trex-motors-keanonbiz.replit.app should show your website
- Homepage should display vehicle inventory
- Contact forms should work with email notifications

## ðŸ”§ Alternative: Force Rebuild
If the deployment still fails:

1. **Stop the current deployment**
2. **Delete dist/ folder** (if you can access it)
3. **Redeploy from scratch**

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result
After redeployment:
- âœ… Website loads at https://trex-motors-keanonbiz.replit.app
- âœ… Shows "Serving production static files from: ..." in logs
- âœ… Homepage displays without login redirect
- âœ… After data import: All 18 vehicles visible

## ðŸ“ž If Still Not Working
The fixes should resolve the __replshield redirect issue. If problems persist, we may need to:
1. Check deployment logs in Replit console
2. Verify environment variables are set in production
3. Ensure PORT environment variable is correctly configured

The local production test confirmed the build works correctly, so the issue is specific to Replit's deployment environment.
